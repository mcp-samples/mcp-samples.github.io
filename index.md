### Theme of the Month - Microservices


Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development designed to speed up deployment cycles, foster innovation and ownership, and improve maintainability and scalability of software applications.

This approach includes scaling organizations that deliver software and services. Using a microservices approach, software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small self-contained teams.

Below, we present additional resources to help you learn more about Microservices.
